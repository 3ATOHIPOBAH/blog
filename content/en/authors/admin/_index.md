## A Little About Myself

Arkhipov Alexander Sergeyevich. I studied at three schools: one in Nizhny Tagil and two in Moscow. I worked at Nova-Light, a company that installs outdoor lighting for homes and at the Wildberries warehouse.

I program, enjoy playing shooters and tennis, and spend a lot of time outdoors.

I am interested in studying the structure of the macroeconomic space, with a particular focus on cryptocurrencies.
